# *CooldownsPlugin*

This is a simple plugin for **Minecraft 1.20.1** that teaches you how **cooldowns timer** on commands can be set for your custom command in a spigot plugin.
In this version, the time is **statically set into the code**, but you could create a command for the server owner to **update the value of the timer** (in milliseconds), modifying a variable in a custom **config.yml** (missing).

## Requirements

To deploy this project you will need a few things:

- A **Bukkit/Spigot Minecraft 1.20.1 Test Server** (it can also be hosted in your machine);
- Donwload the **.jar file**.

**And that's it!**

If you dont have the server already, please follow this **tutorial**:

## Installation

To use the mod, please follow this steps:

1. Make sure that you have the minimum **Requirements** to continue;

1. Insert the **.jar file** into the **plugin** folder of the minecraft server;

1. Execute the **start.bat** file (if you have one) or simply **start the server**.

1. Launch the **pl** (plugin) **command** in the terminal of the server: if the name of the plugin is in **green**, you are good to go.
